# Discover Drupal Final Project

In the Summer of 2022 I received a scholarship for the [Discover Drupal Program](https://www.drupal.org/association/discover-drupal) 
which was created by the [Drupal Association](https://www.drupal.org/association). This initiative provides Drupal training 
scholarships, mentorship, and hands-on experience to folks who are interested in pursuing a career in Drupal and are 
from historically oppressed communities. The program consisted of a Macbook, taking the Drupal Course Online 
with [Mike Anello](https://github.com/ultimike) from [DrupalEasy](https://drupaleasy.com) and attending DrupalCon Pittsburgh 
where we would do a presentation on our final project 
(think of it as the final capstone project in your undergraduate senior engineering program).


# Summary of My Final Project
This landing page is my capstone project. This is a free template that I downloaded 
and customized as a brochure website advertising my web design services. I give some information
about myself, discuss my pricing plans, and add links to drupal sites I've worked on.
